intro = '''
This demo reads data from a file created by recording IMU data from a Pyboard
equipped with an IMU device. The data (in JSON format) contains the 3 IMU
vectors followed by a timestamp in Î¼s.

Initially the board was rotated around each orthogonal axis to calibrate the
magnetometer. A special line was inserted into the file to signal the end of
cal.

The device was then partially rotated in heading, then pitch, then roll: this
data is displayed when calibration is complete.

Calibration takes 15 seconds.
