# CardSet.js [(view code)](https://github.com/jpiland16/hmv_test/blob/master/src/components/visualizer-screen/cards/CardSet.js)

The purpose of this component is to provide informational labels and/or graphs as a dataset is viewed.
However, this code currently relies too heavily on the expectation that the dataset will be of the Opportunity format.
Future modifications should require labels to be present in the data itself.

The labels/graphs appear in semi-transparent divs that can be on the right side of the screen, the bottom of the screen, or completely hidden.
