# Welcome Screen [(link to  relevent file)](https://github.com/jpiland16/hmv_test/blob/master/src/components/home-screen/WelcomeScreen.js)
 - Most of the code at the top of the WelcomeScreen.js file is for a fun little Easter egg hidden in the welcome screen and isn't relevent to the rest of the application.
 - The Welcome Screen React Component consists of:
    - A title bar with options to take user to Getting Started Info, Code Documentation, and the Contact Us Screen
    - A [Home Animation](https://github.com/jpiland16/hmv_test/edit/master/documentation/subpages/HomeAnimation.md)
    - A Launch Visualizer Button - takes the user to the Visualizer Screen
    - A Use OPPORTUNITY Dataset Button- pops up the Dialog Select which allows user to select and OPPORTUNITY dataset trial to view and launches the Visualizer Screen with the file preloaded
    - An Upload File Button- takes the user to Upload Screen
