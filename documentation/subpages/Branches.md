# Important branches
- Refactor Viewport Helpers [(view code)](https://github.com/jpiland16/hmv_test/tree/refactor-viewport-helpers)
  - Has some experimental UI improvements, including a [PlayBar](https://github.com/jpiland16/hmv_test/blob/refactor-viewport-helpers/src/components/PlayBarAlt.js) that
  pauses while you are clicking and holding on it. Generally is outdated.
- Modify Calibration Form [(view code)](https://github.com/jpiland16/hmv_test/tree/modify-calibration-form)
  - Adds a 'sample rate' input to the calibration form, which responds to issue [#14](https://github.com/jpiland16/hmv_test/issues/14). Doesn't yet implement the server-side code to
  properly implement the change.
