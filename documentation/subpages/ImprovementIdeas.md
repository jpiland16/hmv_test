# Ideas for Improvement
- Smartphone dataset support, general support for 'low sensor count' data
- Authentication to prevent users accessing each others' uploads, us seeing uploads
- Multiple viewports for simpler side-by-side comparison (see [Side Branches](https://github.com/jpiland16/hmv_test/edit/master/documentation/subpages/Branches.md))
- No card display on visualizer when there's an error
- Have ROOT bone move on its own instead of pivoting around the origin to solve the issue where the gait dataset has the model swinging back and forward
- Code design that is intuitive enough to reduce the need for 'documentation'
- Get the model to change global position and walk around scene
- Contact the OPPORTUNITY dataset people to see if they would put a link to our website in their site
- Expand the types of sensor data that can be read
- Include a quick way for people uploading their datasets to test a bunch of transformation quaternions and find what works
- Include a tutorial for how to go about finding the transformation quaternions
