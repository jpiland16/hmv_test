The HomeButton is a simple icon with the [logo of the HMV Project](https://github.com/jpiland16/hmv_test/blob/master/public/hmv-favicon-512.png) 
and appears in the top left of the Visualizer screen. Clicking this button takes you to the home page, i.e., the [WelcomeScreen](https://github.com/jpiland16/hmv_test/blob/master/documentation/subpages/WelcomeScreen.md).
